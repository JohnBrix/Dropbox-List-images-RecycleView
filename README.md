# Dropbox-List-images-RecycleView
Using RecycleView and Picasso, i display all the images from using /getTemporaryLink i used list to make sure getting all the values from my data server which is Dropbox api, and used hashset or set as my unique values to get unique data to make it sure data cannot be duplicated. btw its open source so you can try this.

<h1>Actual Images</h1>

- Images is from /get_temporary_link using Dropbox API SDK.
- the path is /images using /list_folder to get the path then pass in /get_temporary_link to display in Picasso
- Picasso as my image renderer.
